Video Explanation: https://clips.twitch.tv/FitHeadstrongLadiesTTours-3Gn7TZTxjf0pNpw1

Download whichever you intend to use and sounds folder. 


Put both in Documents > My Games > Path of Exile

Alternatively you can also follow LeagueStartWitchColdDoT or LeagueStartWitchDD  on my public filters list https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/GucciPradas/item-filters . You still need to download the sounds folder from here even if you follow on the pathofexile website

Check back before league start for potential updates

If you have any feedback feel free to post in the filter feedback channel in discord here  https://discord.gg/W4uKt67jxD

# Do not use LeagueStart filters past a10. Do not use Racing_ filters past act 5. You have been warned.
