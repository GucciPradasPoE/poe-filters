Video Explanation: https://clips.twitch.tv/FitHeadstrongLadiesTTours-3Gn7TZTxjf0pNpw1

Download whichever you intend to use and sounds folder. 


Put both in Documents > My Games > Path of Exile

Alternatively you can also follow my public filters list https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/GucciPradas/item-filters . You still need to download the sounds folder from here even if you follow on the pathofexile website

Check back before league start for potential updates
